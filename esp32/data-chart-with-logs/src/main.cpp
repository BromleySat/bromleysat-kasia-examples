/*
    This is a relative simple example of the use of the Kasia framework

    It connects to WiFi and starts a WebServer at port 80
    Once you navigate to the main page for your device
    You will see a simple page with your DeviceId or DeviceName in the title
    And a single log on the web page's log section that will say that 'Temperature Sensors server started!'

    You will also see a data Chart that will show the temperature readings
    As well as logs with randomly generated number
